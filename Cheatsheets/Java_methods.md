# All HashMap Methods

A list of all HashMap methods can be found in the table below.

Some methods use the type of the HashMap's entries as a parameter or return value. The type of the key will be referred to as *K* and the type of the value will be referred to as *V* in the table.

# Java Iterator Methods

The `Iterator` interface provides methods to access and iterate through collections:

| Method | Description | Return Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| hasNext() | Returns true if there are more elements in the iteration | boolean |
| next() | Returns the next element in the iteration | *T* |
| remove() | Removes the last element returned by next() | void |

**Note:** The `next()` method uses the type of the iterator's items as its return value. This type is referred to as *T* in the table.
